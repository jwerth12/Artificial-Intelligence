Program 1: n-Puzzle

Objective: 
The goal of this project was to explore the inner workers of several algorithms including:
  Iterative-deepening Search
  Breadth-first Search
  A* Search
As well as practice using a software profiler 

The Problem: 
This project focuses on the 8-puzzle, 
which is a 3x3 grid of numbered tiles 1-8 and one blank space.

The blank space allows tiles to be slid on the board (only tiles adjacent to the blank may be moved)
The goal is to slide the tiles into numerical order from left to right, top to bottom 
Tiles may only move orthogonally. 

Code is provided in Python
