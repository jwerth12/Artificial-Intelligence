Program 3: Hexapawn 
Deep feed forward AI nueral network 

Objective: 
The goal of this project was to explore the following 
  - Constructing a directed graph to represent a network 
  - Determine how initial weight configurations affect network's learning 
  - Tuning network parameters 
  - Back propegation 

Problem Definition:
This project uses the game of Hexapawn to explore the noted objectives 

Hexapawn is a simple turn based game played on a 3Ã—3 board. Each player begins with 3 pawns
- WHITE (MAX) in the bottom row and BLACK (MIN) in the top row. Pawns can move as normal
in chess (i.e. white pawns can move up one square or can capture a black pawn diagonally up
one square, and black pawns can move down one square or can capture a white pawn diagonally
down one square). The goal of each player is to either get one of their pawns to the other end of
the board, or to make it such that their opponent is stuck on their next move. 

The provided code learns the puzzle based on if both players move optimally.
