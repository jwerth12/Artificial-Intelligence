Program 2: Sudoku Solver

Objective:
The goal of this project is to explore the following algorithms
  AC-3 and Maintaining Arc Consistency 
  Backtracking Search for CSPs
As well as experience with web services for visualization 

Problem Definition: 
The project focuses on solving a Sudoku number puzzle, set on a 9x9 grid 
Puzzles have digits in each cell 
The solution to the puzzle ensures each row, column, and each of the nine 3 Ã— 3 non-overlapping
subgrids (boxes) contains all of the digits 1 thru 9.

Puzzles start as partially filled out grids. This program solves the puzzle by 
filling in the remaining cells and provides a visualization for a step by step solution guide.
